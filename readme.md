# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

### Another website about food, really...

Yes, but who doesn't like food? 😄

This time, we're going to build a food delivery app, where we can see the meal options, select them, and see the result in our cart.

### Users must be able to :

-   See a list of five meal options
-   See the prices of each meal option
-   Add a meal to the cart
-   Filter the list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones
-   See their total bill
-   “Check out” - this doesn’t have to process payment, just simply display
    a message stating the order as been confirmed.

### Bonus :

-   Change the quantity of meals in the cart
-   Remove a meal from the cart

Here is an example of layout :

And when I click on the _Confirm Order_ button, I can display a message to show the total bill from the order.

### Food list

Here's the food object :

```jsx
const foods = [
	{
		id: 'ravitoto',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Ravitoto',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'pasta',
		price: 4000,
		title: 'Pasta',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'burger',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Burger',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'rice',
		price: 2000,
		title: 'Rice and Leaves',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'mofogasy',
		price: 500,
		title: 'Mofogasy',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
];
```

The **id** here is a unique string, is role is to identify an element inside the list. The title will be the food name shown to the user.

You'll also have an **order** collection, where you will push a food object every time the user add an element to his order.

### Maps, Filter, Reduce, and other friends

-   To generate any list of element (for example, the list of food), **Map** is really useful.
-   To get the full price of list of items, **Reduce** is the perfect use case.
-   To count how many times an item is in a list, you could **Filter** the list and see the length of the result, or use a **Reduce** to count all of the instances.

But this is just one way to think about that. Feel free to try any other logic you have in mind.

### 💡Tips

-   Don't forget to clean your code, and update your readme before Monday morning.

Good luck!

#Readme updates

- Fisrt I create the check box in the html, that seems still ok.
- I create the food list from using map, to loop trough the element to create a list form each element.
- Next up is the creating listenrs in the checkboxes, if the spicy is checked only show the spicy food === true by using innerHtml and similar to the when the vegetarin is check only show the vegetarian food, finaly when they both are checked only show the matching condition, this step is done after filter from the foods collection and maping the result to create list from yhe result. That seems to be wrking fine so far.

- I had a difficulty with showing the elements from the add button to only shoe them at once and add their number. I wanted to use the reduce method here but I still need to work on that. My plan would have been like this:
	- every clicks that matches the button is adding one to the * number and use reduce to calculate the total amount for each type of food and use the whole result from that result and use reduce to calculate the total price of food that are added.

- I did not really have time for the modale but I think I have to grab the button to add an event listener to show the modale. For its html I might be using the value of the total amount of food to the total.
